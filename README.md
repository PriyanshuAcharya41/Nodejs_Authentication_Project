🚀 Features
User Registration: New users can create accounts with unique credentials.

User Login: Existing users can log in with their credentials.

Session Management: Maintains user sessions across different routes.

Password Security: Implements password hashing for secure storage.

Responsive UI: Utilizes EJS templating for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

Templating Engine: EJS

Authentication: Express-Session, Bcrypt

File Uploads: Multer (for handling profile pictures or other uploads)

🧪 Usage
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register to create a new account.

After registration, log in at http://localhost:3000/login.

Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the dashboard.

🔐 Security Considerations
Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using Bcrypt before storage.

Session Management: Sessions are managed securely using Express-Session.

Input Validation: Ensure to implement input validation to prevent injection attacks.

📌 Future Enhancements
Email Verification: Implement email confirmation during registration.

Password Reset: Allow users to reset their passwords via email.

OAuth Integration: Enable login through third-party providers like Google or Facebook.

Two-Factor Authentication: Add an extra layer of security.
